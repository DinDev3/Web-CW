                <h3>Universal Castle</h3>
                Universal Studios Hollywood is a film studio and theme park in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles County, California. About 70% of the studio lies within the 
                unincorporated county island known as Universal City while the rest lies within the city limits of Los Angeles, California. It is one of the oldest and most famous Hollywood 
                film studios still in use. Its official marketing headline is "The Entertainment Capital of LA".[1] It was initially created to offer tours of the real Universal Studios sets 
                and is the first of many full-fledged Universal Studios Theme Parks located across the world.

                Outside the theme park, a new, all-digital facility near the Universal Pictures backlot was built in an effort to merge all of NBCUniversal's West Coast operations into one area. 
                As a result, the current home for KNBC, KVEA and NBC News with Telemundo Los Angeles Bureaus with new digital facility is on the Universal lot formerly occupied by Technicolor SA. 
                Universal City includes hotels Universal Hilton & Towers, the Sheraton Universal Hotel, and Universal CityWalk, which offers a collection of shops, restaurants, an 18-screen 
                Universal Cinema and a seven-story IMAX theater. In 2017, the park hosted 9,056,000 guests, ranking it 15th in the world and 9th among North American parks.[3]

                <h3>Themed Restaurants</h3>
                From the beginning, Universal had offered tours of its studio. After Carl Laemmle opened Universal City on March 14, 
                1915, he later invited the general public to see all the action for an admission fee of just five cents, which also included a boxed lunch with chicken. T
                here was also a chance to buy fresh produce, since then-rural Universal City was still in part a working farm. This original tour was discontinued in around 1930, 
                due to the advent of sound films coming to Universal.[2]

                <h3>Studio Tour</h3>
                Universal Studios Hollywood's back lot has been damaged by fire nine times throughout its history.[4] The first 
                was in 1932 when embers from a nearby brush fire were blown toward the back lot causing four movie sets to be destroyed and resulting in over $100,000 damage.[5] Seventeen years 
                later, in 1949, another brush fire caused the complete destruction of one building and damage to two others.[6] In 1957, the New York street film studio set was destroyed by an 
                arson fire causing half a million dollars in damage.[7] Ten years later, in 1967, twice as much damage was done when the Little Europe area and part of Spartacus Square was 
                destroyed. It also destroyed the European, Denver and Laramie street sets.[8] In 1987, the remaining portion of Spartacus Square was destroyed along with street sets and othe
                r buildings. As with the 1957 fire, this was suspected to be the result of an arsonist.[9] Just three years later, another deliberate fire was started in the back lot. The 
                New York Street set, the Ben Hur set and the majority of Courthouse Square were destroyed.[10] In 1997, the seventh fire occurred at the back lot.[4] A portion of the Courthouse 
                Square was again destroyed, though most survived.[11]

                <h3>The Globe</h3>
                Destroyed were 40,000 to 50,000 archived digital video and film copies chronicling Universal's movie and TV show history, dating back
                 to the 1920s, including the films Knocked Up and Atonement, the NBC series Law & Order, The Office, and Miami Vice, and CBS's I Love Lucy.[14][15][16] Universal president Ron Meyer
                  stated that nothing irreplaceable was lost, meaning everything could be rebuilt again at a price of at least $50 million. Unfortunately while this may be true of the archive of video 
                  material, the fire also destroyed a huge and irreplaceable archive of analogue audio master tapes belonging to Universal Music, including all of Decca's masters from the 1930s to the 
                  1950s and most of the original Chess masters which included artists such as Otis Redding, Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters.[17] Days after the fire, it was reported that the King Kong 
                  attraction would not be rebuilt and would eventually be replaced by a new attraction that had yet to be announced.[18] In August 2008, Universal changed its position and announced 
                  plans to rebuild the King Kong attraction, basing the new attraction on the 2005 film adaptation.

                    <h3>Volcano of Doom</h3>
                Shortly after Music Corporation of America took over Universal Pictures in 1962, accountants suggested a new tour in the studio commissary 
                would increase profits. On July 15, 1964, the modern tour was established to include a series of dressing room walk-through's, peeks at actual production, and later, staged events.[2] 
                This grew over the years into a full-blown theme park. The narrated tram tour (formerly "Glamor Trams"[19]) still runs through the studio's active backlot, but the staged events, stunt 
                demonstrations and high-tech rides overshadow the motion-picture production that once lured fans to Universal Studios Hollywood.[2][20]

                In 1965, the War Lord Tower opened as one of the first attractions in the theme park. One of the early struggles for Universal was coming up with things for young children to do. 
                The existing small Ma & Pa Kettle Petting Zoo was expanded into the Ark Park. This area encompassed the Mt. Ararat petting zoo with over 200 animals and birds representing 30 species 
                and a Noah's Nursery and a Noah's Love Inn playhouse for children and animals.[21] This was followed by the opening of the Animal Actors' School Stage in 1970. In 1968 the Screen Actors 
                Guild enacted a rule prohibiting visitors from most soundstages. This new rule coupled with more productions being shot on location meant the backlot tram tour could not show visitors much 
                in the way of real movie and television production. Jay Stein, President of the Recreation Division championed the idea of creating exciting experiences for visitors in place of viewing 
                actual production. Later that same year, the Flash Flood set was opened and this first special-effects attraction proved to be a hit. 20,000 gallons of water rushed 200 feet down a narrow 
                Mexican village street, uprooting an old tree and threatening to engulf the tram. The Parting of the Red Sea attraction opened in 1973.[21] In 1974, the Rockslide staged event was added to 
                the Studio Tour. The following year The Land of a Thousand Faces opened on the Upper Lot. In 1979, the Battle of Galactica replaced Rockslide as a staged event on the Studio Tour.
