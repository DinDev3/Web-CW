# Web Pages

1. Sitemap

# Tasks

1. Your site should contain a sitemap. The sitemap should have navigation links to
the appropriate part of the group website, and should be developed in SVG.

2. Create a page that allows the user to view images. This page contains a form, 5
thumbnail images, and 2 pull-down menus (to select the page background colour and the
page text colour) and an area to display a larger image and associated description of that
image. When the user selects a thumbnail image, the corresponding large image and the
description of that image should display in the defined location on the form. You may use
onMouseOver or radio buttons to select the thumbnail.

## Common Tasks

1. Your site should contain a link to a CV for each member of your group. This should be a complete CV (written in html) similar to one you would present to a potential employer. Your CV should have your picture at the top right hand-side corner. This page is external to the group website and therefore on this occasion
does not need to follow the design of the main website.

2.  (All students) Any page longer than the screen size should have links to various parts of the
text at the top of the page.

3. (All students) Each page should include your title logo at the top, and a link to the page
editor (the person who wrote the page) at the bottom of the page. (E.g., here you could
make a link to the CV of the person who created that page).

4. (All students) Feel free to use additional JavaScript to add interactivity and increase ease of
navigation.
