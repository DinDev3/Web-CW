# Tasks

1. A presentation page with title and the name of everyone in the group. After 4
seconds, a second page will be displayed (Main Web page).

2. Use JavaScript to create the functionality to increase / decrease the font size
used on the website. The basic functionality should include two buttons - a button to make
the font size smaller and a button to make the font size larger (half allocated marks).
Advanced functionality will allow for the font size to increase in steps up and down (full
allocated marks).

3. Your site should contain a form to allow people to buy products related to the
topic of your web site, i.e. if your topic is football, you could be selling football shirts,
accessories, etc. This should include:
* personal details;

* at least 3 different products to choose from;

* number of items for each product;

* automatically provide the total price of the bill.

* Use JavaScript validation to check that the user has filled-in the following
compulsory fields - personal details, product and number of items. Do NOT use
HTML5 validation for this part.

* If the compulsory fields are filled-in, when the 'place order' button is clicked, the
user should get a popup window with the summary of the order. For example, the
text in the popup window could be something like: "Dear John, you have ordered 2
T-shirts size M at a cost of £20 each and a pair of trainers at a cost of £50. Your
total bill is £90."


## Common Tasks

1. Your site should contain a link to a CV for each member of your group. This should be a complete CV (written in html) similar to one you would present to a potential employer. Your CV should have your picture at the top right hand-side corner. This page is external to the group website and therefore on this occasion
does not need to follow the design of the main website.

2.  (All students) Any page longer than the screen size should have links to various parts of the
text at the top of the page.

3. (All students) Each page should include your title logo at the top, and a link to the page
editor (the person who wrote the page) at the bottom of the page. (E.g., here you could
make a link to the CV of the person who created that page).

4. (All students) Feel free to use additional JavaScript to add interactivity and increase ease of
navigation.
