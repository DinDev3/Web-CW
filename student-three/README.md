# Tasks

1. Your site should contain an interactive multiple choice quiz about the subject
you are developing on your Web site. Once the quiz has been completed, it gives the user a
mark on how he/she performed. This should be time limited. When the quiz is finished
should also display the summary of the user performance (which answers were correct or
incorrect, and how long it took to complete the quiz). The user will get 2 marks for each
correct answer, and -1 for each wrong answer. The quiz should consist of 10 questions. The
background colour of the page should change according to the awarded mark.

2. Your main page should contain four pictures of the members of the group.
When the user moves the mouse over one picture, the details of that member should be
displayed in an area on the page (for example, you could use a div below the pictures). The
details should include the name and role that that student took for the coursework (e.g.
John Smith, Student 1).

## Common Tasks

1. Your site should contain a link to a CV for each member of your group. This should be a complete CV (written in html) similar to one you would present to a potential employer. Your CV should have your picture at the top right hand-side corner. This page is external to the group website and therefore on this occasion
does not need to follow the design of the main website.

2.  (All students) Any page longer than the screen size should have links to various parts of the
text at the top of the page.

3. (All students) Each page should include your title logo at the top, and a link to the page
editor (the person who wrote the page) at the bottom of the page. (E.g., here you could
make a link to the CV of the person who created that page).

4. (All students) Feel free to use additional JavaScript to add interactivity and increase ease of
navigation.
