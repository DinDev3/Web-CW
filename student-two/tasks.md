# Tasks

1. Your Main page should be designed so that the user can access several parts of
the site. The links on your main page should look like buttons and have a hover effect. This
should be created using CSS.

2. Your site should contain a form to send comments about your web site. This
form should include:
* input fields for users to enter their details (name, email address)

* a field to enter comments

* a way to rate your web site (using radio buttons or select)

* Use JavaScript validation to check that the user has filled-in the compulsory fields -
'name' and 'rating'. Do NOT use HTML5 validation for this part.

* If the name and ratings are filled-in, the user should get an HTML popup window
with the summary including the name, any comments and rating given on the
form.
For example, if the user entered "John" for their name, rated the site as "good" and
entered "Very informative website", the popup window should say something like:
"Dear John, Thank you very much for your feedback. You have rated our site
as Good and your comment was Very informative website."

3. Consistency of style should be ensured using a unique external style sheet file main page and navigation

## Common Tasks

1. Your site should contain a link to a CV for each member of your group. This should be a complete CV (written in html) similar to one you would present to a potential employer. Your CV should have your picture at the top right hand-side corner. This page is external to the group website and therefore on this occasion
does not need to follow the design of the main website.

2.  (All students) Any page longer than the screen size should have links to various parts of the
text at the top of the page.

3. (All students) Each page should include your title logo at the top, and a link to the page
editor (the person who wrote the page) at the bottom of the page. (E.g., here you could
make a link to the CV of the person who created that page).

4. (All students) Feel free to use additional JavaScript to add interactivity and increase ease of
navigation.
